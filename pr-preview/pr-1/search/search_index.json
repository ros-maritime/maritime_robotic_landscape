Absolute Beginner? Never used ROS before? Start with the Getting Started Guide for a complete beginner introduction. The tutorials on this page assume you have basic familiarity with ROS concepts. Need to understand the terms? Check the Glossary for explanations of acronyms and concepts. Getting Started with Maritime Robotics Introduction to Marine Vehicles Prerequisites: - Basic ROS knowledge - Understand topics, nodes, and launch files - Basic Linux/command-line - Can navigate directories, edit files - Python or C++ - Know basic programming concepts New to ROS? Start with: - ROS 2 Tutorials - Official beginner tutorials - ROS 2 Basics - Understand what ROS is - Getting Started Guide - Maritime robotics introduction Maritime-Specific Concepts: 1. Vehicle Dynamics: Understanding marine vehicle motion (6-DOF) 2. Coordinate Frames: NED (North-East-Down), ENU (East-North-Up), body frame 3. Environmental Forces: Currents, waves, buoyancy, drag 4. Sensor Limitations: GPS unavailable underwater, acoustic vs. RF communication Recommended Learning Path Simulation First: Start with simulators (VRX, DAVE) before real hardware Simple Vehicles: Begin with surface vehicles (easier to test and debug) Sensor Integration: Add sensors incrementally (IMU \u2192 GPS \u2192 Sonar) Control Basics: Understand PID control before advanced techniques Real Hardware: Progress to physical platforms after simulation success Tutorials Tutorial 1: Setting Up VRX Simulation Goal: Get the Virtual RobotX simulation running with a basic surface vehicle. Steps: Follow the VRX README: Install dependencies, build the workspace, and launch a sample world using the current VRX instructions. Confirm the vehicle spawns: Ensure you see the model in the simulator before proceeding. Publish simple commands: Use ros2 topic pub to command the thrusters (see the VRX docs for topic names and message types). Next Steps: - Explore sensor topics with ros2 topic list - Write a simple controller node - Try competition tasks Resources: - VRX Wiki - VRX Tutorials Tutorial 2: Understanding Thrust Allocation Goal: Learn how multi-thruster vehicles distribute forces. Concept: A vehicle with multiple thrusters needs to determine how to command each thruster to achieve desired forces and torques. This is the thrust allocation problem. Example - 4-Thruster Configuration: Consider a 4-thruster configuration with horizontal thrusters: T1 T2 \u2193 \u2193 \u250c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2510 \u2502 ROV \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2518 \u2191 \u2191 T3 T4 Allocation Matrix T: Each thruster contributes to surge (X), sway (Y), and yaw (N). The allocation matrix relates thruster forces to vehicle forces: [X] [T_matrix] [F1] [Y] = [ .... ] [F2] [N] [ .... ] [F3] [F4] Implementation: Define Configuration in URDF (see thrust allocation packages) Use an existing package (MVP-Control, thruster_manager) Or implement your own: import numpy as np # Pseudo-inverse solution T = np.array([[1, 1, 1, 1], # Surge [0, 0, 0, 0], # Sway (simplified) [0.1, -0.1, -0.1, 0.1]]) # Yaw (moment arms) T_inv = np.linalg.pinv(T) # Pseudo-inverse desired_forces = np.array([10, 0, 1]) # Example values thruster_forces = T_inv @ desired_forces Gotchas: - Thruster saturation - Dead zones - Optimal vs. feasible solutions Tutorial 3: Integrating a DVL with ROS 2 Goal: Set up a Doppler Velocity Log for underwater navigation. Hardware: Various DVL manufacturers (Teledyne RDI, Nortek, LinkQuest) \u26a0\ufe0f Note: The Water Linked DVL A50 ROS driver repository ( waterlinked/dvl-a50-ros-driver ) is archived (last push 2024-02-26). For current DVL driver options, see the WHOI Deep Submergence Lab drivers which support Teledyne RDI DVLs, or check the Drivers page for other options. Steps: Install Driver: Clone the appropriate DVL driver for your hardware. For WHOI drivers, see the WHOI Bitbucket workspace (repo access may require approval): https://bitbucket.org/whoidsl/workspace/repositories/ Configure Connection: Edit the config file for your serial port, baud rate, and frame ID per the device manual. Launch the DVL node: Use your driver package's launch file. Verify Data: Use ros2 topic echo to confirm the driver publishes velocity and altitude. Integrate with robot_localization: yaml # ekf_config.yaml ekf_filter_node: ros__parameters: odom0: /dvl/velocity odom0_config: [false, false, false, # x, y, z position false, false, false, # roll, pitch, yaw true, true, true, # x_dot, y_dot, z_dot false, false, false, # roll_dot, pitch_dot, yaw_dot false, false, false] # x_ddot, y_ddot, z_ddot Next Steps: - Add IMU for full state estimation - Tune EKF parameters - Test in water tank or simulation Tutorial 4: Basic Acoustic Localization Goal: Understand USBL positioning for underwater vehicles. Concept: USBL (Ultra-Short Baseline) uses a surface transceiver to track an underwater beacon: - Measures range (time-of-flight) - Measures bearing (phase difference on transducer array) - Computes 3D position relative to surface unit Simulation Setup: Use a simulator with acoustic positioning (DAVE, custom Gazebo) Configure USBL beacon on vehicle Configure surface transceiver ROS Integration: # Simplified USBL position update class USBLLocalizer: def __init__(self): self.sub = self.create_subscription( USBLFix, '/usbl/fix', self.usbl_callback, 10) def usbl_callback(self, msg): # msg contains: range, bearing, elevation # Convert to Cartesian coordinates x = msg.range * cos(msg.elevation) * cos(msg.bearing) y = msg.range * cos(msg.elevation) * sin(msg.bearing) z = msg.range * sin(msg.elevation) # Publish as NavSatFix or PoseWithCovariance # Integrate with EKF Challenges: - Outlier rejection (multipath, noise) - Time synchronization - Covariance estimation Workshops and Courses REMARO Summer School REMARO Underwater Robotics Hackathon Educational materials from TU Delft underwater robotics workshop.

This page was last updated: December 31, 2025","title":"Contributing Expert Knowledge"},{"location":"faq/","text":"Frequently Asked Questions Common questions from beginners about getting started with marine robotics. Can't find your question? Ask on ROS Discourse ! Getting Started I'm brand new. Where do I start? Start with the Getting Started Guide . It walks you through three paths depending on your commitment level, from just watching videos to building your first robot. The quickest path to hands-on experience: 1. Read What is Marine Robotics? 2. Install a simulator 3. Complete Tutorial 1: VRX Do I need to know programming? Short answer: Basic programming helps, but you can learn as you go. Long answer: - Python is commonly used in ROS 2 - it's beginner-friendly - C++ is used for performance-critical code, but you can start without it - Many tutorials provide copy-paste code to get you started - If you've never programmed: Try Python for Everybody (free course) first Do I need to know advanced math? No! Basic algebra is enough to start for many entry-level tasks. What you'll encounter: - Basic algebra: For simple calculations - Trigonometry: For navigation (sin, cos for angles) - Linear algebra: For coordinate transformations (you'll learn this) - Calculus: For advanced control (not needed initially) The simulators and libraries handle most complex math for you. What operating system do I need? Best: Linux (use the version supported by your ROS 2 distribution) - ROS 2 works best on Linux - Most documentation assumes Linux - Free to install Windows: Use WSL 2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux) - Lets you run Linux inside Windows - Free and officially supported - Installation guide Mac: Partial support - Some simulators work - ROS 2 can be installed but fewer packages available - Consider running Linux in a virtual machine How long does it take to learn? Timelines vary widely based on prior experience, project scope, and access to hardware. Most people learn incrementally while working on projects that interest them. Hardware and Costs Do I need to buy hardware to start? No! Start with free simulators: - VRX (Virtual RobotX) - Surface vehicle simulation - DAVE - Underwater simulation - Gazebo - General robotics simulator You can learn ROS, navigation, control, and sensors all in simulation without spending money. How much does hardware cost? Hardware costs range from DIY builds to professional systems. Prices depend on configuration, payloads, and depth ratings. Recommendation: Join a university lab or competition team to share costs. Prices vary by region, vendor, and configuration. What's the cheapest way to build something real? Most affordable path: Join a team - Share equipment, tools, and knowledge Pool robot in simulation \u2192 pond/pool testing \u2192 ocean deployment Start tethered (ROV) - Cheaper than autonomous (AUV) Buy used components - Check robotics forums, university surplus sales 3D print custom parts - Access makerspaces for tools Realistic first project: Tethered camera robot using low-cost parts. Where can I buy marine robotics components? Popular suppliers (examples): - Blue Robotics - Thrusters, controllers, ROV components (beginner-friendly) - Teledyne - Professional sensors - Amazon/eBay - Generic electronics, Arduino, Raspberry Pi - McMaster-Carr - Mechanical components, hardware - 3D printing services - Custom parts (Shapeways, local makerspaces) University students: Check if your institution has equipment you can use! Education and Age I'm in high school. Can I participate? Absolutely! Many opportunities for high school students: Competitions: - MATE ROV Competition (specifically for students) - SAUVC (Singapore AUV Challenge) - Local robotics competitions Learning: - All online tutorials are free - Many simulators run on modest computers - Online community is very welcoming Funding: Some competitions provide equipment or have student grants; check individual competition resources. I'm not in college. Can I still learn? Yes! This field welcomes: - Hobbyists - Build for fun - Career changers - Transition from other fields - Retirees - Pursue a passion project - Self-taught learners - Online resources are excellent The ROS community values skills and enthusiasm over formal credentials. What degree/major do I need? Common backgrounds: - Robotics Engineering - Mechanical Engineering - Electrical Engineering - Computer Science - Ocean Engineering - Marine Biology (for science payload/applications) But: Many professionals are self-taught or came from unrelated fields. Projects and skills matter more than the degree title. Can I get a job in marine robotics? Yes! There are opportunities in both industry and research: Job titles: - Robotics Engineer - Ocean Technology Specialist - AUV/ROV Pilot & Technician - Controls Engineer - Marine Robotics Researcher - Simulation Developer - Sensor Integration Engineer Employers: - Ocean research institutions (WHOI, MBARI, etc.) - Defense contractors - Offshore energy companies - Environmental monitoring firms - Underwater robotics startups - Universities and research labs Salary range: Varies widely by region, role, and experience. Check local market data for current ranges. Technical Questions What's the difference between ROS and ROS 2? ROS (ROS 1): - Original version - Still used in many existing systems - ROS 1 Noetic EOL: 2025-05-31 (older ROS 1 distributions are already EOL) \u2014 see ROS notice ROS 2: - Modern rewrite with better architecture - Real-time capable - Better security - Recommended for new projects Should I learn ROS 1 or ROS 2? Start with ROS 2. Some older packages only work with ROS 1, but ROS 2 is the current focus for new development. Why can't I use GPS underwater? Physics: Radio waves (including GPS signals) are absorbed very quickly by water. GPS signals are effectively unusable underwater. Solutions for underwater navigation: - DVL (Doppler Velocity Log): Measures speed relative to seafloor - INS/IMU: Tracks position by measuring acceleration (drifts over time) - Acoustic positioning: USBL or LBL systems use underwater sound beacons - Sensor fusion: Combine all sensors using Kalman filters What's the difference between an AUV and an ROV? ROV (Remotely Operated Vehicle): - Connected by tether (cable) to surface - Human operator controls it in real-time - Extended mission duration (powered via cable) - Can transmit live video - Good for: Inspection, deep sea work, tasks needing human judgment AUV (Autonomous Underwater Vehicle): - No tether; operates independently - Follows pre-programmed mission or makes own decisions - Limited by battery life (mission duration depends on vehicle design) - Limited communication while submerged - Good for: Mapping, surveys, long-distance missions Hybrid vehicles exist that can operate in both modes! Why is underwater communication so slow? Acoustic communication limitations: - Low bandwidth: Much lower throughput than WiFi or RF links - High latency: Seconds of delay are common - Multipath: Sound bounces off surface, seafloor, creating echoes - Doppler effects: Moving vehicles shift frequencies Physics: Sound is the only thing that travels well underwater.

Terms are organized alphabetically within categories for easy reference. Core Concepts Marine Robotics / Maritime Robotics : Building and operating robots that work in, on, or underwater environments. ROS (Robot Operating System) : Open-source software framework for building robot applications. Despite the name, it's not an operating system like Windows or Linux - it's a set of tools and libraries that run on top of an OS (usually Linux). Think of it as a toolkit that helps robots' different parts talk to each other. ROS 2 : The current generation of ROS with improved real-time behavior and security features. Autonomy / Autonomous : The robot can make decisions and operate on its own without constant human control. An autonomous robot can navigate, avoid obstacles, and complete missions independently. Simulation / Simulator : Software that creates a virtual environment where you can test robots without needing physical hardware or water. Like a video game for robots - you can make mistakes safely and test ideas quickly. Vehicle Types Surface Vehicles ASV (Autonomous Surface Vehicle) : A boat or ship that operates on the water's surface without a crew onboard. It makes its own navigation decisions. USV (Uncrewed Surface Vehicle) : Similar to ASV - a surface vessel with no people aboard. The terms are often used interchangeably, though USV can include both autonomous and remotely-controlled vessels. WAM-V : Wave Adaptive Modular Vessel - a specific type of catamaran (twin-hull boat) platform used in robotics competitions and research. Underwater Vehicles AUV (Autonomous Underwater Vehicle) : A robot submarine that operates independently underwater. No cable to the surface - it follows pre-programmed missions or makes its own decisions. ROV (Remotely Operated Vehicle) : An underwater robot controlled by a human operator via a tether (cable). The cable provides power and communication. Like flying a drone, but underwater. UUV (Unmanned Underwater Vehicle) : General term for any underwater vehicle without people inside - includes both AUVs and ROVs. Glider : A special type of AUV that doesn't have a propeller. It uses buoyancy changes to glide through the water in a sawtooth pattern. Energy-efficient for long missions. Torpedo-shaped AUV : An AUV with a streamlined, cylindrical hull (like a torpedo). Efficient for long-distance travel in a straight line. Hovering AUV : An AUV with multiple thrusters allowing it to move in any direction and hover in place. Good for detailed inspection work. Sensors and Navigation DVL (Doppler Velocity Log) : A sonar-based sensor that measures how fast the robot is moving relative to the seafloor or water. Essential for underwater navigation since GPS doesn't work underwater. Uses the Doppler effect (same physics that makes ambulance sirens change pitch as they pass you). IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) : A sensor that measures acceleration and rotation. Helps the robot know which way is up and how it's oriented. Contains accelerometers and gyroscopes. INS (Inertial Navigation System) : A more advanced version of an IMU that can calculate position by tracking all movements. Higher accuracy than a basic IMU. GPS / GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) : Satellite-based positioning system. Important: GPS doesn't work underwater! Only useful when a vehicle surfaces. GNSS is the generic term for all satellite navigation systems (GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, etc.). Depth Sensor / Pressure Sensor : Measures water pressure to determine depth underwater. Deeper water = higher pressure. Simple and reliable. CTD (Conductivity, Temperature, Depth) : A sensor package that measures three key ocean properties: - Conductivity: How well water conducts electricity (indicates salinity/saltiness) - Temperature: Water temperature - Depth: How deep the robot is Sonar : Uses sound waves to \"see\" underwater (like bat echolocation). Light doesn't travel far in water, but sound does. Different types: - Imaging Sonar: Creates pictures from sound reflections - Multibeam Sonar: Maps the seafloor - Side-scan Sonar: Creates wide-area images of the seabed - Forward-looking Sonar (FLS): Detects obstacles ahead Hydrophone : An underwater microphone. Listens to sounds in the ocean. Control and Motion DOF (Degrees of Freedom) : The number of independent directions a robot can move. A car has 2 DOF (forward/backward and turn). Marine robots typically have 6 DOF: - Surge: Forward/backward - Sway: Left/right (sideways) - Heave: Up/down - Roll: Rotation around front-to-back axis (like a barrel roll) - Pitch: Rotation around left-to-right axis (nose up/down) - Yaw: Rotation around vertical axis (turning left/right) Thruster : An underwater propeller that pushes the robot. Most marine robots have multiple thrusters to control different directions. Thrust Allocation : The math that figures out how much power to send to each thruster to make the robot move in the desired direction. Azimuth Thruster : A thruster that can rotate to point in different directions. More flexible than fixed thrusters. Buoyancy : The upward force that makes things float. Submarines and AUVs carefully balance their buoyancy to neither sink nor float. Ballast : Weight added to a robot to control buoyancy. Some robots can pump water in/out to adjust their ballast. Control Systems PID Controller : A common control algorithm (Proportional-Integral-Derivative). Helps the robot smoothly reach a target position or heading. Like cruise control in a car. Waypoint : A target position or GPS coordinate the robot should navigate to. A mission might have many waypoints in sequence. Path Planning : Algorithm that calculates the route the robot should take from start to finish, avoiding obstacles. Localization : Figuring out where the robot is. Underwater this is hard since GPS doesn't work - robots use DVL, IMU, and sometimes acoustic beacons. SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) : Building a map of an unknown environment while simultaneously figuring out where you are in that map. Challenging but powerful technique. EKF / UKF (Extended/Unscented Kalman Filter) : Mathematical techniques for combining data from multiple sensors to get a better estimate of position and velocity. Handles noisy sensor data intelligently. Communication Acoustic Communication / Acoustic Modem : Underwater \"wireless\" communication using sound waves. Much slower than WiFi (much lower data rates) but works underwater where radio doesn't. WHOI Micro-Modem : A widely-used underwater acoustic modem developed by Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. Industry standard for underwater communication. RF (Radio Frequency) : Traditional wireless communication (like WiFi, cellular, radio). Works great in air, but doesn't work underwater - water absorbs radio waves quickly. Tether : The cable connecting an ROV to the surface. Provides power and high-bandwidth communication (like an underwater Ethernet cable). Limits how far the ROV can go. Satellite Communication : Communication via satellites. Used by surface vehicles or AUVs when they surface. Expensive but works anywhere on Earth. USBL (Ultra-Short Baseline) : Acoustic positioning system that uses sound to track an underwater robot's position from a surface ship. Measures range and bearing (direction). LBL (Long Baseline) : A network of underwater acoustic beacons deployed on the seafloor. The robot triangulates its position using these beacons. More accurate than USBL but requires setup. Software and Development Gazebo : A widely used robotics simulator. Can simulate physics, sensors, and robot movement in a 3D environment. Free and open-source. VRX (Virtual RobotX) : A simulated maritime robotics competition based on Gazebo. DAVE (Dave Aquatic Virtual Environment) : A simulation environment for underwater vehicles, built on Gazebo. RViz : A visualization tool for ROS. Shows you what the robot \"sees\" - sensor data, camera images, point clouds, etc. Helpful for debugging. Topic : In ROS, a named channel where messages are published. For example, /camera/image might be the topic where camera images are published. Like a TV channel - anyone can tune in. Node : In ROS, a single program or process that does one specific job. A robot might have many nodes working together (one for camera, one for navigation, one for control, etc.). Message : In ROS, data sent over a topic. Has a specific format/structure. Like a package being delivered. Launch File : A file that starts multiple ROS nodes at once with their configurations. Convenient for starting complex robot systems. Colcon / Catkin : Build tools for ROS. Colcon is used in ROS 2, Catkin was used in ROS 1. They compile your code and set up the workspace. Organizations and Institutions WHOI (Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution) : A major ocean research institution in Massachusetts, USA, with a long history in marine robotics and ocean engineering. MBARI (Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute) : Ocean research institute in California with significant work in marine robotics. ROS-Maritime : The working group focused on marine robotics within the larger ROS community. Maintains packages, documentation, and hosts meetings. Competition and Standards RobotX : An international maritime robotics competition for autonomous surface vehicles. Teams compete in tasks like navigation, object detection, and docking. MBZIRC (Mohamed Bin Zayed International Robotics Challenge) : A major robotics competition that includes maritime challenges. SAUVC (Singapore AUV Challenge) : Student-focused underwater robotics competition. Held in Singapore. MATE ROV Competition : Popular student competition for remotely operated vehicles. Multiple divisions from high school to university. Coordinate Frames NED (North-East-Down) : A coordinate system where: - X points North - Y points East - Z points Down (toward Earth's center) - Common in aerospace and marine navigation ENU (East-North-Up) : A coordinate system where: - X points East - Y points North - Z points Up (away from Earth) - Common in robotics and computer graphics Body Frame : A coordinate system attached to the robot. X typically points forward, Y to the right, Z down. Moves and rotates with the robot. Miscellaneous Terms Open-source : Software where the code is freely available for anyone to use, modify, and share. ROS and most tools in this landscape are open source. URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) : An XML format for describing a robot's physical structure (links, joints, sensors). Tells ROS what your robot looks like. TF / TF2 (Transform) : ROS system for tracking coordinate frames. Keeps track of where different parts of the robot are relative to each other and the world. Workspace : In ROS, a directory containing your code and packages. Where you do development. Package : In ROS, a collection of related code, configuration files, and documentation organized together. Like an app or library. Repository / Repo : A place where code is stored and version-controlled, usually on GitHub or GitLab.

Document limits in your SOPs and update them based on field experience. Limitations to consider: - GPS accuracy degrades (antenna motion) - Acoustic modem performance drops (surface bubbles) - Solar panels less effective (shadowing from waves) - Hull slamming can damage equipment UUV deployment: - Launch/recovery most critical phase - Launch/recovery often has stricter limits than submerged operation - Once submerged, UUV largely unaffected by surface conditions - Deep thermoclines caused by storms can affect acoustics Current Limits Vehicle capability: - Strong currents can prevent waypoint following and increase power consumption - Define abort criteria based on your vehicle's measured performance Impact: - Increased power consumption (fighting current) - Poor station-keeping - Mission duration reduced - Path deviations increase Mitigation: - Plan missions with/across current (not against) - Increase speed margins in planning - Use current profiles if available - Have abort criteria (if drift exceeds X meters) Temperature Effects Battery performance: - Capacity drops in cold conditions - Very cold environments can cause permanent damage - Use manufacturer derating curves when available Electronics: - Temperature ratings vary by component - Pressure housings can help stabilize temperature - Sensors may need time to stabilize Acoustic propagation: - Thermoclines bend sound (can create shadow zones) - Warm surface, cold deep = sound bends down - Affects acoustic modem range and USBL accuracy Depth Limitations Design implications: - Verify depth ratings for every pressure-bearing component - Pressure housing cost increases with depth - DVL range and acoustic performance can limit operations Failure Modes and Recovery Critical Sensor Failures DVL Failure Symptoms: - No bottom lock - Erratic velocity readings - Beam status errors Immediate actions: 1. Switch to IMU-only dead reckoning (short term) 2. Surface for GPS fix if possible 3. Reduce mission to lower speed (dead reckoning degrades with speed) 4. Abort if position accuracy critical Prevention: - Pre-mission warm-up - Check beam status before critical maneuvers - Plan missions within bottom-lock range IMU Failure Symptoms: - Orientation divergence - Attitude solution errors - High residuals in EKF Immediate actions: 1. If hovering ROV: Surface immediately (no attitude = no control) 2. If torpedo AUV: May continue with degraded performance 3. Check magnetometer (often fails separately from gyros) 4. Attempt recalibration if possible Prevention: - Pre-flight calibration - Avoid magnetic interference sources - Temperature stabilization time GPS Failure (Surface Vehicle) Symptoms: - No fix or stale fix - Large position jumps Immediate actions: 1. Continue with dead reckoning (DVL + IMU if available) 2. Check antenna connection 3. Check for obstructions (debris on antenna) 4. Try rebooting GPS receiver Recovery: - Most failures are cable/connector issues - Salt buildup can block antenna - Requires return to shore for repair Acoustic Modem Failure Symptoms: - No responses to commands - Corrupted messages - Complete silence Immediate actions: 1. Vehicle continues autonomous mission (if programmed) 2. Wait for scheduled surface (can't command abort) 3. Monitor expected surface location for recovery Prevention: - Always program autonomous abort conditions - Don't rely solely on acoustic for critical commands - Have time-based or location-based automatic surface Mechanical Failures Thruster Failure Single thruster: - Thrust allocation can often compensate - Reduced performance but mission may continue - Monitor power draw on remaining thrusters Multiple thrusters: - Abort mission - Activate emergency surface procedure - Jettison weights if equipped Common causes: - Seaweed/debris entanglement - Electrical short - Bearing failure (noise, vibration) Leak Detection Symptoms: - Water in pressure housing - Conductivity sensor alarm - Unexplained power loss Immediate actions: 1. Emergency surface immediately 2. All thrusters full up 3. Drop weights if equipped 4. Activate recovery beacon Prevention: - Careful O-ring maintenance - Vacuum test before deployment - Don't over-torque hatches Software/Control Failures Controller Instability Symptoms: - Oscillation in position or attitude - Growing amplitude oscillations - Erratic thruster commands Immediate actions: 1. Switch to backup controller (if available) 2. Reduce controller gains 3. Emergency surface if unsafe Common causes: - Incorrect tuning for actual vehicle - Sensor noise not filtered - Actuator saturation causing integrator windup EKF Divergence Symptoms: - Position estimate jumps - High innovation values - Covariance growing unbounded Immediate actions: 1. Reset EKF if possible 2. Disable faulty sensor input 3. Switch to primary sensor only (e.g., DVL-only navigation) Prevention: - Proper covariance tuning - Sensor timeout detection - Outlier rejection Data Management Mission Data Collection Essential logging: - All sensor raw data (for post-processing) - State estimates (position, velocity, attitude) - Control commands (thruster outputs) - System status (CPU, power, temperatures) - Timestamps (synchronized across all sensors) Data rates: - Sensor rates vary widely by hardware and configuration - Estimate storage based on your configured rates and payloads Post-Mission Processing Quality checks: 1.

These platforms are commonly used for: Hydrographic surveying and mapping Environmental monitoring Autonomous cargo transport Search and rescue operations Oceanographic data collection Characteristics: - Degrees of Freedom: Typically 3-4 DOF (surge, sway, yaw, sometimes heave) - Typical Sensors: GPS/GNSS, IMU, cameras, radar, lidar, weather stations, AIS - Propulsion: Propellers, azimuth thrusters, water jets, sail (for autonomous sailboats) - Power: Batteries, solar panels, diesel generators, hybrid systems - Communication: RF, cellular, satellite Common Platforms: - Autonomous survey vessels - Wave energy converters (WEC) - Autonomous sailboats - Multi-hull vessels (catamarans, trimarans) Underwater Vehicles Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) AUVs are untethered robotic submarines that operate independently underwater. They come in two main configurations: Torpedo-Shaped AUVs Design: Streamlined, cylindrical hull optimized for forward motion Propulsion: Rear-mounted propeller(s) Use Cases: Long-range missions, oceanographic surveys, pipeline inspection DOF: Primarily 6-DOF but optimized for forward motion Hovering AUVs Design: More compact, multi-thruster configuration Propulsion: Multiple thrusters for omnidirectional movement Use Cases: Detailed inspection, intervention tasks, confined spaces DOF: Full 6-DOF (surge, sway, heave, roll, pitch, yaw) Typical Sensors: - Doppler Velocity Log (DVL) for velocity and altitude - Inertial Navigation System (INS) / IMU - Depth sensor / pressure transducer - Sonar (imaging, multibeam, side-scan, forward-looking) - Cameras (visible light, low-light) - CTD (Conductivity, Temperature, Depth) - Hydrophones Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs) ROVs are tethered underwater robots controlled by operators on the surface. Characteristics: - Tether: Physical cable for power and communication - Control: Real-time operator control with varying levels of automation - DOF: Typically 4-6 DOF depending on thruster configuration - Power: Supplied via tether (mission duration limited by surface support) - Use Cases: Deep-sea exploration, underwater construction, ship hull inspection, scientific research Common Configurations: - Observation-class ROVs: Lightweight, for inspection - Work-class ROVs: Heavy-duty, with manipulators - Hybrid ROVs/AUVs: Can operate in both modes Underwater Gliders Gliders are a special class of AUV that use buoyancy control for propulsion. Characteristics: - Propulsion: Buoyancy engine (no propeller) - Motion: Sawtooth pattern through water column - Endurance: Long-duration missions, depending on vehicle design - Speed: Slow relative to propeller-driven vehicles - Use Cases: Long-duration oceanographic monitoring, large-scale surveys - Sensors: Typically CTD, oxygen sensors, fluorometers, acoustic sensors Specialized Platforms Autonomous Sailboats Unmanned sailing vessels using wind power for propulsion. Propulsion: Wind-powered sail with autonomous control Endurance: Long endurance with proper design Use Cases: Ocean monitoring, long-duration surveys, racing competitions Control Challenges: Wind prediction, sail trim optimization, path planning Intervention Vehicles Underwater vehicles equipped with manipulators for interaction tasks. Manipulators: Robotic arms (typically 1-2 per vehicle) End Effectors: Grippers, cutters, sensors, tools Use Cases: Valve turning, sample collection, cable laying, underwater construction Bio-Inspired Vehicles Vehicles that mimic marine animal locomotion. Biomimetic fish: Fin-based propulsion Turtle robots: Flipper-based propulsion Jellyfish robots: Pulsed propulsion Use Cases: Research, stealth operations, efficient low-speed propulsion Vehicle Comparison Compare vehicles using measurable, documented factors from manufacturers and field reports: Operating environment and depth rating Mission duration and energy source Required degrees of freedom and maneuverability Communications constraints Payload capacity and integration needs This page was last updated: December 31, 2025","title":"Vehicle Types"},{"location":"vehicle_types/#maritime-vehicle-types","text":"Maritime robotics encompasses a diverse range of vehicle platforms, each designed for specific environments and missions.
