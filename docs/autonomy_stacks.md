# Maritime Autonomy Stacks

A maritime autonomy stack is a collection of software modules that enable autonomous operation of marine vehicles, providing a modular and scalable architecture for sensing, perception, planning, control, and mission execution. These stacks allow unmanned surface and underwater vehicles to perform complex missions with varying degrees of human intervention.

## Full-Stack Frameworks

These frameworks provide end-to-end autonomy components for maritime vehicles.
