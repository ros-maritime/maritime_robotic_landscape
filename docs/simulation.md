## Simulation Comparison

Rather than a scored table, compare simulators using verifiable criteria from their documentation:

- Supported ROS version and Gazebo/engine version
- Sensor and vehicle models available
- Licensing and open-source status
- Hardware requirements
- Maintenance status and recent activity

## Simulation Best Practices

### Choosing a Simulator

1. **Vehicle Type**: Match simulator to your platform (ASV → VRX, AUV → DAVE/Stonefish)
2. **Sensor Requirements**: Ensure simulator supports your sensors (especially sonar for underwater)
3. **Physics Needs**: Consider required fidelity for hydrodynamics, waves, currents
4. **ROS Version**: Check compatibility with your target ROS distribution
5. **Computational Resources**: Consider available hardware (GPU for OceanSim, CPU for others)

### Integration Tips

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic models before adding complexity
2. **Validate Physics**: Compare simulation to real-world data when available
3. **Use Standard Interfaces**: Leverage ROS 2 control interfaces for portability
4. **Version Control**: Track simulation parameters and world files
5. **Document Assumptions**: Record simplifications and model limitations
